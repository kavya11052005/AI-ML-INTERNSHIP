**Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Titanic Dataset)
1.What is Data Preprocessing?

Data preprocessing means turning messy, raw data into clean, organized data that a machine learning model can use.
___________________________________
**Steps Followed
1.Imported the data using Pandas.
2.Explored the data to understand its structure and missing values.
3.Handled missing values by filling in with median (for Age) and mode (for Embarked), and dropped the Cabin column.
4.Encoded categorical variables (Sex, Embarked) using one-hot encoding.
5.Standardized numerical features (Age, Fare) so they have mean 0 and std 1.
6.Visualized and removed outliers in Fare using boxplots and IQR method.

**Tools Used

->Python
->Pandas
->Numpy
->Matplotlib/Seaborn
->scikit-learn

Cleaning and transforming the data helps the model learn better and make more accurate predictions.
